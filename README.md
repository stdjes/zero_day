# Zero Day Project
  
  Welcome to my first project using git run locally from my desktop. This project is an optional task assigned to us on the ALX SE program.

  >This README file is expected to have different markups

  1. Connect to your VM
  2. Download Vagrant
  3. Run Ubuntu

  "I guess that will be all for now."

  *This readme will be updated with time.
